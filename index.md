## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) under
the supervision of [Dr Jie M. Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/jie-zhang/home) with a 
research focus on the intersection between software engineering and responsible AI.

With over 8 years of industry experience in software engineering and technical leadership
roles, I’m passionate about bridging industry knowledge with cutting-edge research to 
contribute to the creation of robust and innovative AI systems.

I’m actively looking for opportunities to make connections and gain research experience.
